GarminSD CHANGELOG
==================
v0.7 - 10nov2019:
         -  Explicitly switches off gps position logging in case it is
            on by default (a user reported this to be the case on a Vivoactive 4
	 -  Tidied up logging to Garminsd.txt log file so it does not fill up
	    too quickly (does not repeat the same message over and over).
	 -  Reports communications error codes onto the watch screen
	    (Error codes defined in https://developer.garmin.com/downloads/connect-iq/monkey-c/doc/Toybox/Communications.html)

v0.6 - 21oct2019: Fixed problem with Vivoactive3 hardware button exiting app without prompt, and adjusted position of fields on screen.

v0.2 - 07apr2019 - added confirmation dialog to make it harder to exit the
     app accidentally.
v0.1 - Initial working version
