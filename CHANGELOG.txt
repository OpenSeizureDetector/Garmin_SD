GarminSD CHANGELOG
==================


v2.0 - 29Mar2024
	- Many battery optmisation improvements by @pmithrandir.  
	  Note, only sends 3d data, not magnitude, so needs android app V4.2.4
	        or higher.

v1.4 - 18aug2023:
	- Added configuration menu to allow user to select whether to play a sound, light up the watch or vibrate when 
	  an alarm or error occurs.
	- Adjusted use of timers to reduce chance of crashes.
v1.0 - 06jan2020:
	- Added system info to settings http response for improved logging.
	- Changed acceleration output to be true vector magnitude, not the
	  approximation we used on the Pebble.

v0.8 - 16feb2020:
	- Added system info to settings http response for improved logging.
	- Changed getStatus to use the makeWebRequest rather than makeJsonRequest function, which is deprecated.
	- Moved battery percentage to same line as heart rate so it 'should'
	fit on smaller screens.


v0.7 - 10nov2019:
         -  Explicitly switches off gps position logging in case it is
            on by default (a user reported this to be the case on a Vivoactive 4
	 -  Tidied up logging to Garminsd.txt log file so it does not fill up
	    too quickly (does not repeat the same message over and over).
	 -  Reports communications error codes onto the watch screen
	    (Error codes defined in https://developer.garmin.com/downloads/connect-iq/monkey-c/doc/Toybox/Communications.html)

v0.6 - 21oct2019: Fixed problem with Vivoactive3 hardware button exiting app without prompt, and adjusted position of fields on screen.

v0.2 - 07apr2019 - added confirmation dialog to make it harder to exit the
     app accidentally.
v0.1 - Initial working version
