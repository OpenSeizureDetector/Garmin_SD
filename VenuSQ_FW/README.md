VenuSQ Firmware
===============
This folder contains firmware files downloaded from the Garmin Support Site, archived in case they disappear.   They are necessary because Garmin Firmware Updates have resulted in unreliable connection between the watch and the phone when running OpenSeizureDetector - see [Issue #26](https://github.com/OpenSeizureDetector/Garmin_SD/issues/26) for details.

We do not know if the beta test software in this folder was ever released, so it is probably best to use the known public release (410) in the folder instead.

The installation instructions (From the Garmin support site) are:

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

  - Connect your VenuSq to your computer using the USB cable.
  - Download and unzip VeunSq_beta.zip. Place the GUPDATE.GCD file in the \GARMIN folder of your device's internal storage drive.
  - Safely eject the storage drive from the computer, approve the update on the watch, and wait for the update to finish.
  - If you would like to revert to the last public release software, place the GUPDATE-410.GCD file in the \GARMIN folder. Rename GUPDATE-410.GCD to GUPDATE.GCD before eject the device storage drive. NOTE: If you revert to an older version of software, all of your settings will be reset to defaults.
